Digital Clock with Built in Timer in Python

This is a simple digital clock with a calendar and built in timer. It was built in Python 3.
You will need to install playsound or similar module. pip install playsound
I used a Star Trek TNG sound effect for the timer: https://www.trekcore.com/audio/ 

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your desired time in minutes in the entry box. 
3. Program will convert to seconds.
4. Select Set Timer.
5. Select Start.
















5. Timer will chime with the desired sound when the counter reaches 0. 
6. Program will display “BREAK TIME”.
7. Enter a new time in the entry box to continue. Select Set Timer > select Start. 
8. Select X to exit out of the program.
