## Digital Clock with Built in Timer in Python

This is a simple digital clock with a calendar and built in timer. It was built in Python 3.  
You will need to install playsound or similar module. (**pip install playsound**)  
I used a Star Trek TNG sound effect for the timer: https://www.trekcore.com/audio/   

1. Run the program.
2. Enter your desired time in minutes in the entry box. Program will convert to seconds.
3. Select **Set Timer**.
4. Select **Start**.

5. Timer will chime with the desired sound when the counter reaches 0. 
6. Program will display “**BREAK TIME**”.
7. Enter a new time in the entry box to continue. Select **Set Timer** > select **Start**. 
8. Select **X** to exit out of the program.
